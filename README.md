# qk-1
An analog for my “dream computer”.

An emulator for the QK-1 microcomputer.

**THIS EMULATOR WAS CREATED AS AN ANALOG FOR THE REAL DEVICE!**

This computer has yet to be created physically. I created this emulator as a general end design goal. Things **100%** will change!

That said, feel free to play with it.
