# qk-1

An emulator for the QK-1 Z80 microprocessor trainer.

With the first prototype now in existance (which I am STILL very excited about!) this emulator now serves as both a "demo" of sorts and as a method of checking software before deployment.

The emulator currently has the following issues:

-Inaccurate screen emulation. (Lots of flickering...)
-No sound.

If you want the full experience, well, you can always build the device! Schematics are included.

Or you could be incredibly patiant. I do plan on creating both a surface mount and FPGA version. This thing _is_ supposed to be as cheap as possible after all!
