<title>QK-1 Reasoning for Existance</title>
</head>
<body>
<b>Abstract</b>
<p>Everyone in the past 20+ years has interacted with a cheap nasty four function calculator. The things probably cost a dozen or two cents to make and are full on omnipresent at this point. I can guarantee that if you went abroad to some of the most exploited global south countries (eg: South Sudan) and showed the people there a dollar store calculator <i>everyone would recognize it.</i> Hell, most of them probably used one at some point!</p>

<p>Personally I find the fact we can metaphorically flood the earth with calculators is an incredible technological and human achievement! I find it somewhat.... Humbling.</p>

<p>The real inspiration for the QK-1 are those "Chinese Special" Sharp EL506 clones. The "56 function" scientific calculators that've existed since I think the mid to late 80s? Anyway Dollar Tree sold these calculators under the "Jot" brand in the late 2010s. Ignoring build quality these things where really nice because they where compact and feature rich for only $1 USD. Really wish they still sold them!</p>

<p>Fun fact: I decapped a couple of my EL506 clones alongside the regular four function calculators and the scientific calculators have smaller dies which means they're <i>manufactured on a smaller more advanced process node.</i></p>

<p>So there I was staring at my EL506 clone during ~2018 or something and I thought to myself: "If modern technology means we can put an entire scientific calculator on one microscopic ultra cheap silicon die, then why not a fully programable computer?" So I had my nonexistant engineers work on the problem.</p>

<p>Obviously it couldn't be a very complex or powerful computer, limited die space and all that, but it didn't have to be. Just take one of the many microprocessor trainers from the 1970's and crush it all down to a sub 4mm<super>2</super> silicon chip!</p>

<p>Of course the QK-1 ever becoming that ultra cheap and integrated is a complete fantasy. (Most people have fantasies about scenarios involving sex. <i>Mine is this.)</i> Developing an ASIC is <b>FANTASTICALLY</b> expensive! But hey I can always get fairly close with FPGAs, and there's always the possibility of the Chinese cloning the thing! Infact <i>tricking the Chinese into cloning the QK-1 is something I've brainstomed.</i> I just want the thing to exist! I don't need to make a profit off it....</p>

<p>It's amusing. You have all these modern 8 bit """"retro"""" computers like David's Commander X16. Full on whiz-bang machines with impressive graphics and sound capabilities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I'm over here going "What if Z80 but in cheap calculator" lmfao. Eh, there is RISC-V which is FOSS and thus no licensing costs. Issue is RISC-V is <b>JUST</b> the ISA and you have so much god damn fragmentation with that architecture.</p>
